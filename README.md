# CNN-From-Scratch

<p align = "justify"> Inspired by the popular "How to Confuse Machine Learning" meme, which humorously compares Chihuahuas to blueberry muffins, I decided to take on the challenge of engineering a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. Without using modern deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, my goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between Chihuahuas and muffins, ultimately testing whether this meme is truly confusing for an ML model. </p>

<p align = "justify"> HOWEVER, this project is not yet complete. I am currently stuck at the backpropagation phase. Contributions are welcome. If you'd like to help, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request or suggest improvements. Thank you in advance! </p>
